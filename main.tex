\section{Abstract} % A.B.
Procedural generation, as a method used in creating video games, has experienced a significant increase in popularity in recent years.
It has been employed extensively in acclaimed titles such as \textit{Minecraft} and \textit{No Man's Sky} to create virtually infinite worlds that the player is free to interact with.
On the other hand, a recent game \textit{Hyperbolica} shed a light onto a novel idea of making the virtual worlds even more interesting by setting them in non-Euclidean spaces.
The objective of this thesis is to create a small video game incorporating both of the aforementioned concepts.

\section{Vocabulary} % A.B.
\textbf{Hyperbolic geometry} -- geometry obtained by replacing Euclid's parallel postulate with the following axiom: "For any given line $R$ and point $P$ not on $R$, in the plane containing both line $R$ and point $P$ there are at least two distinct lines through $P$ that do not intersect $R$." \\
\textbf{Elliptic geometry} -- geometry obtained by replacing Euclid's parallel postulate with the following axiom: "Through any point in the plane, there exist no lines parallel to a given line."\\
\textbf{Procedural world generation} -- a technique that allows for creating content (commonly terrain) in a video game, animated movie etc. in an automated manner, that is by the means of an algorithm rather than using manually crafted assets.\\
\textbf{NPC} -- non-player character.\\
\textbf{FPS} -- frames per second.\\
\textbf{GB} -- gigabyte.\\
\textbf{RAM} -- random access memory.\\

\subsection{Executive summary}

This application is supposed to combine two effects often seen in video games. The first effect is world generation known from games such as Minecraft. The second one is Moving the gameplay to non-Euclidean spaces. This effect is know form games like Hyperbolica. The application will be available on Windows and will make use of OpenGL for rendering.
