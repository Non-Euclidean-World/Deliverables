\section{Technologies selection}
The video game is written in C\# and uses OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) for the shaders.

The game relies on the following third-party libraries:
\begin{itemize}
    \item OpenTK -- a set of low-level C\# bindings for OpenGL; used for 3D rendering,
    \item BepuPhysics2 -- a low-level, highly performant physics simulation library; used as the physics engine,
    \item SkiaSharp -- API for rendering 2D images; used for 2D rendering (menus, controls, etc.),
    \item AssimpNet -- a .NET wrapper for the Open Asset Import (Assimp) library; used for loading models.
\end{itemize}
