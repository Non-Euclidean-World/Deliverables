\section{Game management}

The user can manage the game in two ways.
Using the in-game menu or using the CLI.

\subsection{In game menu}
The in-game menu appears after pressing escape.
It is a simple menu with the following options:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Resume: Resumes the game.
    \item Save: Saves the game.
    \item Load: Loads a saved game.
    \item Exit: Exits the game.
\end{itemize}

Load and save will open a screen with the saved games.
The saves are arranged in a 3 by 3 grid and the user can select one of them by clicking on it.
The user can also delete a save by clicking on it and then clicking on the delete button.
The user can also create a new save by clicking on an empty save slot.
The user can load/save the game by clicking on the load/save button after selecting a save slot.
There is a limited number of save slots.

\subsection{CLI}
The CLI is a simple command line interface.
It can be used to do all the things that can be done using the menu.
To activate the CLI the user has to press the \texttt{T} key.
This will pause the game and wait for input into the console.
The user can then type in a command and press enter to execute it.
These commands include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item resume: Resumes the game.
    \item save: Saves the game.
    \item load: Loads a saved game.
    \item exit: Exits the game.
\end{itemize}
