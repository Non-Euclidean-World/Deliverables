\subsection{Controllers}

There are 8 controller classes in the project:

\begin{itemize}
    \item PlayerController
    \item BotsController
    \item ChunksController
    \item ProjectilesController
    \item VehiclesController
    \item LightSourcesController
    \item HudController
    \item BoundingShapesController
\end{itemize}

All the controller classes serve the same purpose.
They exist to render objects and deal with object callbacks.
For example ProjectilesController renders all existing projectiles and also removes the dead projectiles from the scene.
Each projectile has a IsAlive property which is read every time render frame callback is called by the controller to check if the projectile is still alive.
