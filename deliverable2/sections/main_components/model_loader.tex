\subsection{Model Loader}

The model loader is responsible for loading the models from the file system.
It loads Collada files using AssipmNet to converts them to model class objects.
Each vertex in the mesh of the model must be dependant on at most 4 bones.
It creates voas for each mesh of the model and stores them in the Model class object and loads a .png file and stores it in a Texture class object.
