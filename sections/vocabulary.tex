\textbf{Hyperbolic geometry} -- geometry obtained by replacing Euclid's parallel postulate with the following axiom: "For any infinite straight line $L$ and any point $P$ not on it, there are many other infinitely extending straight lines that pass through $P$ and which do not intersect $L$."\cite{Hyperbolic-Wolfram} \\
\textbf{Elliptic geometry} -- geometry obtained by replacing Euclid's parallel postulate with the following axiom: "Through any point in the plane, there exist no lines parallel to a given line."\cite{Elliptic-Wolfram} \\
\textbf{Procedural world generation} -- a technique that allows for creating content (commonly terrain) in a video game, animated movie etc. in an automated manner, that is using an algorithm instead of using manually crafted assets.\\
\textbf{NPC} -- non-player character.\\
