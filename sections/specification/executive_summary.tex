\subsection{Executive summary}

The video game is written in C\# and targets .NET 7 on Windows.
The two main libraries used in the development are OpenTK\footnote{OpenTK (\url{https://github.com/opentk/opentk}) is a C\# wrapper for OpenGL.} (used for rendering)
and BepuPhysics\footnote{Highly performant\cite{BepuPhysics} physics simulation library, available at \url{https://github.com/bepu/bepuphysics2}} (as the physics engine).
Models used in the game were created in Blender.
Techniques of rendering in non-Euclidean spaces are based on a paper by Szirmay and Kalos.
Terrain generation was implemented using the marching cubes algorithm,
where the underlying scalar field was generated using Perlin noise.
