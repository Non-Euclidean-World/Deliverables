\subsection{Uninstalling the game}
The game saves are stored in the \path{C:\Users\<your _user_name>\AppData\Roaming\Hyper} folder.
This location can also be accessed by typing \texttt{cd "\$env:APPDATA/Hyper"} in PowerShell.
It's advisable to remove this folder together with the game installation folder.
