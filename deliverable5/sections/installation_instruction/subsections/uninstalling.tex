\subsection{Removing the game}
The game saves are stored in the \path{C:\Users\<your _user_name>\AppData\Roaming\Hyper} folder.
This location can also be accessed by typing \texttt{cd "\$env:APPDATA/Hyper"} in PowerShell.
To remove all game files from your computer, remove this folder as well as the installation folder.
If you want to preserve the game saves you can just delete the installation folder.
