\subsection{Non-functional requirements}
Non-functional requirements are separated into 5 categories: functionality, usability, reliability, performance and sustainability.
The requirements are listed in \autoref*{tab:non_functional_requirements}.

        \textbf{Requirements area} & \textbf{Requirement \#} & \textbf{Description}                                                                                                                  \\ \hline
        Functionality              & 1                       & The application should offer world generation in 3 different spaces as well as means to explore them.                                 \\ \hline
        Usability                  & 2                       & The application targets .NET 7 platform on Windows 10 and newer. The application should have a menu and gameplay controls.            \\ \hline
        Reliability                & 3                       & The application should run without crashing or memory leaks for extended periods of time.                                             \\ \hline
        Performance                & 4                       & The application should run at around 60 FPS with a resolution of 1920x1080 on a computer with at least Intel Core i7-1260P and 16 GB of RAM. \\ \hline
        Sustainability             & 5                       & The game should have good documentation for public classes which makes fixing bugs and making improvements much easier.                                                  \\ \hline
        Sustainability             & 6                       & The game should have detailed test cases for regression testing so that we can be assured that new features do not break the game. This will make future improvements much easier.                                                  \\ \hline
