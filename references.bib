  abstract = {Curved spaces are very un-intuitive to our eyes trained on Euclidean geometry. Games provide an interesting way to explore these strange worlds. Games are written with the help of modeling tools and game engines based on Euclidean geometry. This paper addresses the problem of adapting 3D game engines to the rules of curved spaces. We consider the conversion of Euclidean objects, geometric calculations, transformation pipeline, lighting and physical simulation. Finally, we identify where existing game engines should be modified.},
